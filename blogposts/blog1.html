							Although I had used many primary sources before in my undergraduate work they were
							mostly sources in translation or transcription and thus this project was the first time I got to work
							(almost) directly with the sources, which were mainly Victorian newspapers. I would have to
							say that being able to see the originals (even in scanned form) brought a sense of immediacy and
							immersion, which is one of most exciting aspects of being a historian. It is quite exciting to
							know that so many historical documents can be viewed in its original form now online, which
							opens up many new avenues for inquiry. However, I do believe that with digitized collections,
							new issues and problems will need to be addressed. A significant issue in this new digital age
							that should be considered is the use of keyword searches, which is a large component of this
							project. For this project, I simply put in the term “Whitechapel” into the search engine and
							processed the results. For the British Newspaper Archives (BNA), this method brought well
							over 2000 pages of results. This may seem like a large number of articles focused on
							Whitechapel, but I discovered a large number of these articles were actually advertisements for
							whitechapel carts, which did not relate to the neighbourhood of Whitechapel itself. Furthermore,
							there appears to have been a Whitechapel in Liverpool, which further augmented the search
							numbers. These examples demonstrated for me some of the problems that using a search engine
							could have on research results. Although the Whitechapel in Liverpool was quite easy to
							identify and exclude, a more careless or less observant researcher could have easily mistaken it
							for Whitechapel, London. I only caught on to this fact because articles mentioning Whitechapel,
							Liverpool were discussing streets I was unfamiliar with (having worked on the London Times
							first I had fairly good knowledge about the major streets) and further digging revealed that there
							was a Whitechapel in Liverpool. Thus, as historians we have to recognize that technology is a
							great tool, but our own intuition and observation skills are equally important in picking up what 
							machines cannot do. In the future, with the possibility that programs can be designed to count
							frequencies of words in a collection (I wouldn’t be surprised if something of the sort is already
							being designed and tested), I wonder how this problem of relevance can be overcome? The
							problem with the Whitechapel carts and Whitechapel, Liverpool clearly demonstrates that
							keyword searches can be problematic.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another reservation I have with keyword searching are the blinders that it could place on
							our understanding of the period. A vivid example I remember was an article from 1885 on the
							Tower Bombing Case. Interested in the surrounding articles, I decided to peruse some
							surrounding articles before moving on. It seemed that the most important news item was not the
							Tower Bombing investigation (which had been reported on for several days already), but that of
							the death of General Gordon at Khartom. Had I not looked around, I would not have known of
							the other issues the Victorians faced on that particular day. True, the large quantity of articles
							surrounding the Tower Bombing in January to February of 1885 demonstrates the significance
							and interest the Victorians had, but I still have the feeling that I am missing something. A
							keyword search affects the flow of research and is very different from going to the physical
							archives and combing through the stacks and stacks of papers. But how can we know for sure
							that quantity represents significance? Victorian papers add a further wrinkle by not always
							putting the most important articles near the front (e.g. the Times, who’s first page consists solely
							of advertisements). In the end, history itself is an attempt to complete a puzzle with missing
							pieces, and thus digital history finds the same epistemological issues that has pestered other
							fields of history for a very long time. Yet, I am quite excited about the new possibilities and
							effects digital tools will have on the humanities as a whole.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although I have outlined some reservations about digital history’s methods and practices,
							I still find that this is the most exciting and promising field as technology radically transforms
							our discipline. This project, for example, would have been impossible without keyword
							searches. The digitization of history is the biggest change to the dissemination of knowledge
							since the invention of the printing press. Digital tools allow for collaborative work which may
							change the relatively solitary workflow of the historian. OCR allows for rapid searching of
							archives and allows one scholar to do the work of many (imagine if we had to use a team of RAs
							combing though thousands of newspapers just to look for “Whitechapel”!) The use of digital
							tools (even something as simple as email) has already changed the way history is practiced, as
							knowledge can be transferred nearly instantaneously, and there will definitely be more changes
							in the future.
						</p>
						<p>
							On specific aspects of the research I did, I found it very interesting to examine the
							development of a single neighbourhood in London at the end of the nineteenth century through
							newspapers alone. It very much gave a feel on how day to day life was for Londoners, what
							their concerns were, and how they perceived their fellow Londoners. My work on the BNA gave
							me quite a thorough knowledge of life in the neighbourhood from 1885 to July 1887. One of the
							more interesting trends were the philanthropic endeavors of the middle and upper classes of
							London for Whitechapel. These endeavors were embodied by several royal visits to key
							institutions such as the London Hospital and the Working Lads’ Institute. The most significant
							royal visitor was none other than Queen Victoria herself, who visited the neighbourhood and
							surrounding areas in the summer of 1887 to open the People’s Palace. The royal family did
							leave its mark on the neighbourhood (perhaps that is one of the reasons Prince Albert Victor had
							at one time been suspected to be the Ripper), and I think that these visits embodied the spirit of 
							upper-middle class philanthropy. Smaller organizations, such as the Metropolitan Garden
							Association, strove to represent this as they attempted to provide for less fortunate Londoners.
							Yet this philanthropy did seem to be a hobby, or a way to be seen in high society. The
							aforementioned Garden Association wrote articles that made it seem that open spaces would
							revolutionize the health and wellbeing of Whitechapelers. However, from my research on the
							period after 1888 (after the Ripper murders) I cannot recall any more royal visits. Philanthropy
							seemed to lose its status as being an upper class hobby and was passed on to more radical
							institutions, most notably the Salvation Army. I am of course merely speculating from what I
							have read so far, but I think the issue of philanthropy and how it was administered seemed to
							change greatly after the Ripper murders, and this is definitely something that could be examined
							further.
