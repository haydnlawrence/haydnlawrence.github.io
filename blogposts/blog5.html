<p>The tale of Israel Lipski and the other Whitechapel mapping project</p>

<p>Amy Milne-Smith - May 16, 2018</p>

<p>The following is one of many contributions I have made to the Histories of Whitechapel website, part of the Survey of London&#39;s recent online project. This is an attempt to do a long history of the architecture and streets of Whitechapel from its foundations to the present day. It is made up of their own research team but also hoping to rely heavily on public contributors. Most contributors are residents or former residents of the area sharing their personal stories. I met with the team early on when I found out my own project overlapped somewhat with their own and agreed to help them beta test the website. I have added contributions to add to the historical backstory of the region, and found it a wonderful opportunity for collaboration. Many&nbsp;digital humanists have been at the forefront of&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 1880s, Batty Street was considered part of Whitechapel in the public imagination. Perhaps no better proof of this is in the fact that when a murder occurred in this building in 1887 it was dubbed the &quot;Whitechapel murder.&quot; Before the sensational Jack the Ripper murders of the following year overshadowed it, the murder and its aftermath was considered a major scandal. The case seemed a strange one; a young pregnant woman was found poisoned in her bed with a young man insensible on the floor. That young man was a tenant in the same building, and though he had seemingly had no previous contact with the woman, was charged with her murder. The case garnered particular attention as it was taken up by the crusading Pall Mall Gazette, and Lipski was defended by a particularly active solicitor, a Mr. Hayward.</p>

<p>The victim, the murderer, and most of the witnesses were part of the recent wave of Jewish immigrants from Poland. Without any overt anti-semitism in the reporting, the coverage does clearly lay out the actors in the case as &quot;others&quot; who need translators despite living and working in the heart of London. After fervent campaigns to get Lipski a reprieve, and rumours of new evidence that would exonerate the man, he suddenly provided a fulsome and rather eloquent confession.</p>

<p>However, clearly for the neighbourhood, lingering problems remained. The widow of the young victim was himself in court not long after Lipski&#39;s execution. He had been harassing and even physically assaulting the landlady at the property where his wife was killed and he had recently been resident. No explanation was ever forthcoming as to why he held a grudge against his landlady, and what it might have had to do with the most sensational murder trial of the year.</p>

<p>The afterlife of 16 Batty Street never matched such drama, and yet like all buildings in Whitechapel, its afterlife reflects the dynamic changes of the neighborhood. The house was rebuild in 1887 and later served as a Yemeni seaman&#39;s mission. In more recent years it was transformed into a mosque before being extensively renovated and transformed into a private home.</p>
